# Bone-Aligner
Quickly align two bones

Bone Aligner is a Blender tool for aligning bones in Edit Mode based on their names.

It offers two functions:  

Active to Selected: Aligns the active bone to a selected bone with the same name.  

Selected to Active: Aligns a selected bone with the same name to the active bone.

Includes a case-sensitive option and only works in Edit Mode, with a prompt to switch modes if used elsewhere.

Ideal for aligning bones in armatures during animation or rigging, ensuring consistent bone positions and transforms.
